I started working on the PCB and schematic today.  
This was the phase where everything was still coming together — placing components, wiring the logic, and figuring out how the star layout would actually work in practice. It felt messy at first, but seeing the circuit slowly take shape was really satisfying.

Today was mostly about routing… and then routing again. I ended up having to redo all the tracks. Even using the bottom layer (blue), there were still a lot of conflicts because of the number of LEDs and how tight the star shape is. It took way longer than I expected, but I finally got everything connected cleanly. Now the board actually makes sense electrically and visually !:)
